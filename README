Place username and passwords for both Strava and Motoactv web portal
in motoactv_exporter.py.  Run motoactv_exporter.py from command line.
Note: this implementation depends on command line access to "tidy" to 
clean up the indentation of .tcx files for upload to Strava. Strava
only accepts XML with proper indentation.  Sigh.
